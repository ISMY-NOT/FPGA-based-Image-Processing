# FPGA-based-Image-Processing
Three functions implemented based on FPGA: 1. image greyscaling, 2. image Gaussian filtering, and 3. image edge detection. And Matlab is used to write the corresponding programme to implement the image processing functions. Write the program for face detection using python-opencv library to implement the function of face detection.
